Please follow the instructions provided to you by third parties to unsubscribe from their messages.

At this time, we do not track our Users&rsquo; personal information over time and across third-party online services. This law also requires operators of online services to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their Users&rsquo; online activities over time and across different online services when the Users use the operator's service.

        <li class="li3">Be careful while traveling. We recognize and believe in the importance of being inclusive of all gender identities and sexual orientations, but the reality is this: nowhere in the world is without potential risk, and some countries have specific laws that target LGBTQ+ people.</li>
        <li class="li3">Check out the laws around you when you travel to a new place and research what types of legal protection, if any, are available to you based on sexual orientation.</li>
        <li class="li3">If you have added a sexual orientation to your profile and choose to be shown on Crowder.</li>
        <li class="li3">It&rsquo;s important to exercise extra caution if you choose to connect with new people in these countries - as some law enforcement have been known to use apps as tools for potential entrapment. Some countries have also recently introduced laws that criminalize communications between individuals on same-sex dating applications or websites and even aggravate penalties if that communication leads to sexual encounters.</li>
